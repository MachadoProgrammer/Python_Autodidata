# Program with classes 

````Object-oriented programming

. Classes

-> Be dinamic and adaptable to any situation
    -> When we get together properties, functions and functionalities 
    -> Instances created from classes
    -> reutilization in many different places 
    
    -> __init__ -> initial behaviour, caracteristics

## Class Methods

````Function -> Methods
                class methods
                static methods

1. self.algo -> variavel de instacia
2. cls ->  passa a classe inteira como parÃ¢metro e nao a instancia
